Almost every project needs to have authentication even-though laravel makes it easier, I wanted to have this solved. Instead of making it everytime I start a project. Hope it helps someone else.

This is the scaffold of authorization that uses Laravel as the backend, Vue as the frontend and the frontend is an SPA.

## How to run the code

1. `git clone` repo.
2. `npm install`.
3. `composer install`
4. configure db.
    1. Create `.env` file
    2. Fill information for database
5. `php artisan key:generate`
6. `php artisan passport:install`
7. `php artisan db:seed`
8. Run servers
9. `php artisan serve`
10. `npm run dev`
11. Enjoy
